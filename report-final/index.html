                  State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when
                  creating your site, and describe how you did that .

                    <p>First</p>
                    <p>I had to learn how to create forms for a couple pages in my website. MDN web docs was a highly useful 
                      resource for completing this and I was able to learn a lot about them.
                    </p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Second</p>
                    <p>I had to learn how to stack text on top of images using the z-index property in CSS. Again, MDN web docs was very
                      helpful iin learning how to do this. I had a very difficult time with this at first and couldn't figure out why
                      my text opacity was matching the background image before I used the z-index.
                    </p>

                  <li>
                    <p>Third</p>
                    <p>I had to learn how to use and implement flexbox to build my website layouts. CSS-tricks website has a great
                      resource for understanding how flexbox and its properties work to build a great layout. I learned how truly powerful 
                      flexbox is and have learned so much.

                <p>
                  What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why?
                </p>
                <p>My overall layout of content and my site map worked well. I think the content I chose was really clear for a user 
                  trying to learn more about biotechnology. I also think the news cards I implemented worked really well. Although, I 
                  didn't add relevant content, I do think that a user can see these cards and know that a unique story is contained in each card.
                </p>

                <p>
                  What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might
                  you do things differently another time?
                </p>
                <p>I think that my website can be more responsive and I could have taken steps from the beginning to incorporate some 
                  @media styling for smaller screen sizes. Sadly, I ran out of time before I could incorporate this and some Javascript 
                  functionality into the site.
